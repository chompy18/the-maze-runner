## Fibonacci series - with length and 2 initial values
Implement a function that returns a fibonacci series (each number is the sum of the previous 2).
The function receives 2 parameters (length, initialValues): 
1. **length** - the length of the returned series
2. **initialValues - first & second values** in the series [array]. 
If no param are passed - first two will be [0, 1].
If only one is passed, the second will be set to default of '0' ([5] -> [0, 5]).
