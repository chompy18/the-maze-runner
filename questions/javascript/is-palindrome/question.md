## Check if string is a Palindrome

Given a string, find if it is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

For example, given the string "madam" or "nurses, run" the function should return true.

Note that the function should disregard spaces and punctuation.
